Aceu's Simple Ambulance Help Command Script

A simple /help command to assist your EMS / Ambulance Personnel in their jobs. 

Commands: 

/help

Use: Teleport the player to the hospital (directly to the check in doctor, vector can be changed in server.lua) if there are no EMS on duty. 
(If there is an EMS on duty, the EMS has to do /helptoggle to enable the command to players)

/helptoggle

Use: If there is an EMS on duty and they are unable to respond to the distress or maybe the body bugged out causing it to be invisible to the eyes of the EMS, the EMS may use this command to allow players to use the /help command.

Note:

Ambulance and Police are the jobs that can use the /helptoggle (Can be changed in server file)

Player will teleport in Pillbox Hospital using kiiya's Pillbox Interior @ https://kiiya.tebex.io/package/6458530 (Vector can be changed in server file)
